                        <br>
                        <A Href="#importGallery">import gallery</A>
                        <br><br>
                        <A NAME="createNewGallery">create new gallery</A>
                        <br>File &gt; New &gt; Choose the folder to create gallery.
                        <br>A &quot;gallery&quot; folder will be created at selected location. 
                        The pictures and xml files will be saved on this folder.
                        <br>The content from this gallery folder will be copied later to gallery folder on the web server where JcsPhotGallery client is installed.
                        <br>A first album will be created (application's left side represented in a tree).
                        <br>On the application's right side (gallery panel), Gallery name and Home page should be updated. 
                        <br>Just change the text and it will be automatically updated.
                        <br><br>By mouse left click action on the new created album (a number like &quot;1342635573899&quot;), the album edit panel will be shown.
                        <br>By mouse right click action on an album (just one empty album at this moment), a popup menu will be shown. 
                        <br>Choose &quot;Add new image(s)&quot; and a choose file dialog will be shown as in the bellow screenshot. Multi-selection is allowed.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img style="border: 0px solid; width: 600px;" alt="JcsPhotoGallery - Add images to album" src="AddImagesToAlbum.png">
                        <br><br>
                        <br>After pictures import (shown in the right-bottom progress bar), 
                        <br>expand the album node and it will display the new imported pictures in a tree hierarchy. 
                        <br>Just click on one of it and the image will be shown in Picture Panel.
                        <br>Name and description can be edited for each picture.
                        <br>To rotate or navigate to the next/previous picture use the buttons or navigation arrows keys (up/down).
                        <br>Mouse right click on any picture allows functions as delete or set the album thumbnail (the album's image).
                        <br>Add new album or delete the selected album are also on the popup menu.
                        <br>For each album should be defined tags (at least one tag) separated by ; character.
                        <br>On JcsPhotoGallery client these tags help sorting the albums as shown in bellow screenshot.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img style="border: 0px solid; width: 600px;" alt="JcsPhotoGallery - sort by tags" src="JcsPhotoGalleryTags.png"><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <A Name="saveGallery">Save gallery</A>
                        <br>File> Save
                        <br>If any changes are performed, at close application's action a message will ask to save them.
                        <br><br>
                        <A Name="preferences">Preferences</A>
                        <br>All images added to gallery are resized to the resolution specified in preferences dialog (default and recommended: 1280x960 pixels).
                        <br>Because usual screens fit properly a picture with this size and the file size is bellow 100kB allow  a faster load over internet.
                        <br>Higher resolution decrease performance over slow internet connections (as many users still have),
                        <br>so do not change that unless you need the pictures outside of JcsPhotGallery client.
                        <br>The check box: Remove also the .jpg files... 
                        <br>means that the deleted pictures in this application will be also deleted from storage not just from xml files (recommended enable).
                        <br><br>
                        <A Name="importGallery">Import gallery</A>
                        <br>File&gt; Import &gt; Choose the gallery.xml file
                        <br>look for a gallery.xml file.
                        <br>The gallery format used in previous version (1.0.x) can't be imported.
                        <br>Every time the application is started it will open the last edited gallery.
                        <br>
